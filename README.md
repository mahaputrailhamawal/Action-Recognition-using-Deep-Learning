## <div>Object Detection for Dementia Therapy</div>

This project is about action recognition for Activity of Daily Living therapy for elderly people with dementia. In this project, to get the skeleton data using an open source library, namely from OpenPose. Then to get the training model and action classification using the Convolutional Neural Network method. This project uses the Tensorflow library for training and classification purposes. 

## <div>Documentation</div>

You can see the [OpenPose Documentation](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) for full documentation on installation, testing and customing on your project. As for the Tensorflow library installation process, you can type this command (pip install tensorflow) in your command prompt.

## <div> Requirements</div>

- **Python >= 3.7.0**
- **OpenPose Library**
- **Tensorflow Library**

## <div>Demo</div>

You can see the Demo or Simulation from this project in this link (https://youtu.be/Mk21oLwLT4k). If you want to download the training model that I made, you can click this link (https://intip.in/TrainedModel).

## <div> Suggestion</div>

In this project, the system can recognize the action being carried out 3 times, namely standing, sitting, and walking. This project still has shortcomings, namely in terms of the fps obtained and the hardware used. For future development, there will be several additions, namely the addition of action data tailored to the needs of dementia patients and optimization of action recognition.
